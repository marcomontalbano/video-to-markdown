    <h2>A browser extension</h2>
    <p>
        Originally, this tool started as a simple website where you could paste a video URL and instantly get a nicely formatted
        Markdown snippet with the video thumbnail and title.
    </p>
    <p>
        But over time, we ran into limitations: many websites restrict access to their content from external services, which made
        it harder to reliably fetch video metadata just from a pasted URL.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s why we moved to a browser extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        By running directly in your browser, the extension can access video information from the page you’re currently viewing,
        with your permission. This makes the tool:
    </p>
    <ul style="margin: 0; list-style: none; padding: 0 1rem;">
        <li>🔍 More accurate — it works directly with the content you’re seeing</li>
        <li>⚡ Faster — no need to copy and paste URLs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Just click the extension when you’re on a video page, and it will instantly generate the Markdown code for you —
        thumbnail included.
    </p>
    <p>
        This change helps the service stay reliable, and super easy to use.
