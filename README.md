Add videos to your markdown files easier [starting from here](https://video-to-markdown.marcomontalbano.com/)!


## Why?

How often did you find yourself googling _¨How to embed a video in markdown?¨_

While its not possible to embed a video in markdown, the best and easiest way is to extract a frame from the video, add a layer with a play icon and link the video url on the image.

Speaking HTMLese, this is what you would do:

```html
<a href="{video-url}" title="Link Title"><img src="{image-url}" alt="Alternate Text" /></a>
```

that translates into markdown as:

```md
[![Alternate Text]({image-url})]({video-url} "Link Title")
```

To speed up the process I developped this tool that will do it for you.

You just need to paste the video url in the field above and you will get the markdown you need.

## A browser extension

Originally, this tool started as a simple website where you could paste a video URL and instantly get a nicely formatted
Markdown snippet with the video thumbnail and title.

But over time, we ran into limitations: many websites restrict access to their content from external services, which made
it harder to reliably fetch video metadata just from a pasted URL.

That’s why we moved to a browser extension.

By running directly in your browser, the extension can access video information from the page you’re currently viewing,
with your permission. This makes the tool:

- 🔍 More accurate — it works directly with the content you’re seeing
- ⚡ Faster — no need to copy and paste URLs

Just click the extension's "Generate" button when you’re on a video page, and it will instantly generate the Markdown code for you - thumbnail included.

This change helps the service stay reliable, and super easy to use.


## Development stuff

To run the project locally, here’s what you’ll need:

### Requirements

```

* `CLOUDINARY_URL` ( **required** ) - this is the `API Environment variable` that you can get from your Cloudinary dashboard inside the **Account Details** section.

```sh
