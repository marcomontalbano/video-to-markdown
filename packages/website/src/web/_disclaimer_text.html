This is an open source project with no sponsors.
Images are generated via <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    href="https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/nfvt85kdqleszdah0hxq?t=default">Cloudinary</a> and stored
in it thus reducing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://workers.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare
    Worker</a> quota consumption.
I'm trying doing my best using free services which I cannot guarantee will always be 100% up and running.
To be totally safe, I suggest you generate the video image and download it, storing it directly into your repository or
server.<br />
If you like this project and you find it useful, you can
<a class="sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/sponsors/marcomontalbano">
    sponsor it <i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
</a>
or just 
<a class="star" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/marcomontalbano/video-to-markdown">
    star it
    <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
</a>!<br />
You can also <span class="review">write a review <i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i></span> directly from the
extension details page if you prefer.
